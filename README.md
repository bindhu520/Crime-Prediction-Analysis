# Crime-Prediction-Analysis
The capability to predict any crime on the basis of time, location and so on can help in providing useful information to law enforcement from strategical perspective.

Crimes are a common social problem affecting the quality of life and the economic growth of a society. It is considered as an essential factor that determines whether or not people move to a new city and what places should be avoided when they travel . With the increase of crimes, law enforcement agencies are continuing to demand advanced geographic information systems and new data mining approaches to improve crime analytics and better protect their communities
Although crimes could occur everywhere, it is common that criminals work on crime opportunities they face in most familiar areas for them. By providing a data mining approach to determine the most criminal hotspots and find the type, location and time of committed crimes, we hope to raise peopleâ€™s awareness regarding the dangerous locations in certain time periods. Therefore, our proposed solution can potentially help people stay away from the locations at a certain time of the day along with saving lives. On the other hand, police forces can use this solution to increase the level of crime prediction and prevention.for police resources allocation. It can help in the distribution of police at most likely crime places for any given time, to grant an efficient usage of police resources . By having all of this information available, we hope to make our community safer for the people living there and also for others who will travel there.
